"Even in the Bucharest Virgin and Child, the painting which might seem to be the
closest of the three to an exercise in naturalism, the painter retains in one
crucial detail his taste for refined and graceful poses - the left hand of the
Virgin descends in an elegant vertical line within the space formed by her bent
leg without grasping or even touching the body of the Christ Child, whose
position is thus rendered dangerously unstable." [@papi2019burlington,S.541]
